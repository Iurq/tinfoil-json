# Requirements

* Nintendo Switch running CFW ([Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases) with [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases) recommended)

* Relies on [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io) 

* You are recommended to DELETE the current Tinfoil locations.conf [switch/tinfoil/locations.conf] from your SD card before adding server.

* To avoid getting banned make sure you have already setup [Exosphere / DNS MITM (click here for the guide)](https://rentry.org/ExosphereDNSMITM).

*** You have to set up Oauth if you cannot download  「something」  from tinfoil ***
* Follow the Guide to set up: https://bit.ly/38HEr48

Q: Why no shop is loaded?

> A: This usually occurs when the time of your switch does not the same as the real-time. Please use [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time) to adjust the time of your switch. Or The shops you are trying to access could be down currently.


Q: I can't open tinfoil... :(

> A: Make sure that you install the latest [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases/latest) in your switch and are booting with fusee.bin instead of hekate. Then try to reinstall tinfoil.


Q: network error 7 occurs?

> A: Maybe it is a poor network connection. If you are using a LAN cable, you can try to reinsert it.
